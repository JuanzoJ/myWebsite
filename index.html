  <p id="specificparagraph">Hey! I'm a teacher from the Philippines, and I've been bringing my passion for education to Waukegan High School - Brookside for three years now. Currently, I teach 9th-grade special education, where I have the exciting role of co-teaching physics and a success class. It's been an incredible journey, yet full of learning and shared moments.</p>

</ul>
<ol class="check">
  <li>Acquire an acoustic or electric guitar based on your preference and budget.</li>
  <li>Start with fundamental chords like C, G, D, E minor, and A minor. Practice transitioning between them.</li>
  <li>Develop a basic strumming pattern with downstrokes and upstrokes to build rhythm.</li>
  <li>Choose simple songs that use the chords you've learned. This helps make practice enjoyable.</li>
  <li>Set aside regular time for practice. Focus on chord changes, strumming, and playing songs to build your skills.</li>
